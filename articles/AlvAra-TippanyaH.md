## Structure
Brahma-Meemamsa Shastra Consists of a Total of 4 Adhyaya-s (chapters) (This is further divided into two categories)

- सिद्धद्विकम् Consists of 2 Chapters dealing with what is already 'siddha'
  - समन्वयाध्यायः Chapter proves that all the Upanishadic passages converge in accepting the Brahman as the Sole cause of the Universe
  - अविरोधाध्यायः Chapter proves that there is no contradiction of other Vedic or allied texts in accepting the Brahman as the Sole cause of the Universe and this is also logically correct
- साध्यद्विकम् Consists of 2 chapters that deals with what has to be achieved hereafter
  - साधनाध्यायः Chapter deals with all issues concerning the worship of the Supreme Lord to attain Moksha
  - फलाध्यायः Chapter deals with all issues concerning the nature and other aspects of the 'phala' - Moksha

### 2
- स्मृति-पादः This Pada establishes that there is NO contradiction of the Smriti texts to the fact that the Supreme Brahman is both the material and efficient cause of the Universe!
- तर्क-पादः This pada establishes that even purely from the logical point of view, the Sankhya and other schools are faulty and the Vedanta school alone stands the test of logic.
- वियत्-पादः This pada discusses the exact nature in which the Universe emerges from the Supreme Brahman to further establish the causality of the Supreme Brahman.
- प्राण- पादः This pada, discusses the nature of how implements of the Jivatma viz. the Prana and other sense organs emerge from the Supreme Brahman. (to further establish the same theory)
