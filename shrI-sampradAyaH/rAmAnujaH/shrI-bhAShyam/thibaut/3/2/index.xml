      <description>SECOND PĀDA. In the intermediate sphere the creation (is effected by the soul); for (Scripture) says (so). So far it has been shown that the soul in the waking state suffers affliction since, in accordance with its deeds, it goes, returns, is born, and so on. Next an enquiry is instituted into its condition in the state of dream. With reference to the state of dreaming Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;There are no chariots in that state, no horses, no roads; then he creates chariots, horses and roads.</description>

      <description>And some (state the soul to be) the shaper; and sons, and so on. And the followers of one śākhā state in their text that the dreaming soul is the shaper of its desires: &amp;lsquo;He, the person who is awake in those who sleep, shaping one desired thing (kāma) after the other.&amp;rsquo; The term &amp;lsquo;kāma&amp;rsquo; there denotes not mere desires, but such things as sons and the like which are objects of desire.</description>

      <description>But it is mere Māyā; on account of the true nature (of the soul) not being fully manifested. The things appearing in dreams-chariots, lotus tanks, and so on&amp;ndash;are absolute Māyā, i.e. things created by the Supreme Person. For the term &amp;lsquo;Māyā&amp;rsquo; denotes wonderful things, as appears from passages such as &amp;lsquo;She was born in the race of Janaka, appearing like the wonderful power of the divine being in bodily shape&amp;rsquo; (devamāyā).</description>

      <description>But owing to the wish of the highest it is hidden; for from that are its bondage and the opposite state. The but sets the objection aside. Owing to the wish of the highest, i.e. the Supreme Person, the essential nature of the individual soul is hidden. The Supreme Person hides the true, essentially blessed, nature of the soul which is in a state of sin owing to the endless chain of karman.</description>

      <description>Or that (results) also from connexion with the body. The obscuration of the soul&amp;rsquo;s true nature results either from the soul&amp;rsquo;s connexion with the body or from its connexion with the power of matter in a subtle state. As long as the creation lasts, the soul is obscured by its connexion with matter in the form of a body; at the time of a pralaya, on the other hand, by its connexion with matter of so exceedingly subtle a kind as not to admit of differentiation by means of name and form.</description>

      <description>And it is suggestive, according to Scripture; this the experts also declare. The things seen in dreams are not created by the wish of the individual soul for this reason also, that according to Scripture dreams are prophetic of future good or ill fortune. &amp;lsquo;When a man engaged in some work undertaken for some special wish sees a woman in his dream, he may infer success from his dream vision.</description>

      <description>The absence of that takes place in the nāḍīs and in the Self, according to scriptural statement. Next the state of deep dreamless sleep is enquired into. Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;When a man is asleep, reposing and at perfect rest, so that he sees no dream, then he lies asleep in those nāḍīs&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 6, 3); &amp;lsquo;When he is in profound sleep and is conscious of nothing, there are seventy-two thousand veins called hita which from the heart spread through the pericardium.</description>

      <description>Hence the awaking from that. Since Brahman alone directly is the place of deep sleep, Scripture is able to declare that the souls awake from that, i.e. Brahman; compare &amp;lsquo;Having come back from the True they do not know that they come from the True&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, io, 2), and other texts.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the absence of that.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>But the same, on account of work, remembrance, text, and injunction. Does the same person who had gone to sleep rise again at the time of waking, or a different one?&amp;ndash;Since the soul in deep sleep frees itself from all limiting adjuncts, unites itself with Brahman, and thus being in no way different from the released soul, is no longer in any way connected with its previous body, organs, and so on; the person rising from sleep is a different one.</description>

      <description>In the swooning person there is half-combination; this being the remaining (hypothesis). With regard to a person lying in a swoon or stunned, the question arises whether that state of swoon is one of the other states, viz. deep sleep and so on, or whether it is a special condition of its own.&amp;ndash;The former alternative must be accepted. For the term &amp;lsquo;swoon&amp;rsquo; may be explained as denoting either deep sleep or some other acknowledged state, and there is no authority for assuming an altogether different new state.</description>

      <description>Not on account of place even (is there any imperfection) of the Highest; for everywhere (it is described) as having twofold characteristics. The different states of the individual soul have been discussed, to the end that an insight into their imperfections may give rise to indifference towards all worldly enjoyments. Next now, in order to give rise to the desire of attaining to Brahman, the Sūtras proceed to expound how Brahman&amp;rsquo;s nature is raised above all imperfections and constituted by mere blessed qualities.</description>

      <description>Should it be said &amp;lsquo;on account of difference&amp;rsquo;; not so, because with reference to each the text says what is not that. But, an objection is raised, we observe, that the individual soul also, although in reality possessing the same twofold attributes, viz. freedom from all evil and so on, as we learn from the teaching of Prajāpati (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 7), yet is affected with imperfections owing to the fact that it is</description>

      <description>Some also (teach) thus. Moreover, the followers of one śākhā explicitly teach that the connexion with one and the same body is for the individual soul a source of disadvantage, while for the highest Brahman it is nothing of the kind, but constitutes an accession of glory in so far as it manifests him as a Lord and Ruler, &amp;lsquo;Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on without eating&amp;rsquo; (Mu.</description>

      <description>For (Brahman is) without form merely, since it is the principal agent with regard to that. Brahman, although by entering into bodies, human, divine, and so on, it becomes connected with various forms, yet is in itself altogether devoid of form, and therefore does not share that subjection to karman which in the case of the soul is due to its embodiedness.&amp;ndash;Why?&amp;ndash;Because as it is that which brings about names and forms it stands to them in the relation of a superior (pradhāna).</description>

      <description>And in the same way as (a Brahman) consisting of light; (the texts thus) not being devoid of meaning. In order that texts such as &amp;rsquo;the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo; may not be devoid of meaning, we have to admit that light (intelligence) constitutes the essential nature of Brahman. But analogously we have also to admit that Brahman possesses the &amp;rsquo;twofold characteristics&amp;rsquo;; for otherwise the texts declaring it to be free from all</description>

      <description>And (the text) says so much only. Moreover the text &amp;rsquo;the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo; only teaches that Brahman has light for its essential nature, and does not negative those other attributes of Brahman&amp;ndash;omniscience, being the cause of the world, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;which are intimated by other texts. What is the object of the negation in &amp;rsquo;not so, not so&amp;rsquo; will be shown further on.</description>

      <description>(This Scripture) also shows, and it is also stated in Smr̥ti. That Brahman is a treasure as it were of all blessed qualities and free from all imperfections, the whole body of Vedānta-texts clearly declares: &amp;lsquo;That highest great lord of lords, that highest deity of deities&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;He is the cause, the lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither parent nor lord &amp;lsquo;; &amp;lsquo;There is no effect and no cause known of him, no one is seen like unto him or higher.</description>

      <description>For this very reason comparisons, such as reflected images of the sun and the like. Because Brahman, although abiding in manifold places, ever possesses the twofold characteristics, and hence does not share the imperfections due to those places, scriptural texts illustrate its purity in the midst of inferior surroundings by comparing it to the sun reflected in water, mirrors, and the like. Compare e.g., &amp;lsquo;As the one ether is rendered manifold by jars and the like, or as the one sun becomes manifold in several sheets of water; thus the one Self is rendered manifold by abiding in many places.</description>

      <description>But because it is not apprehended like water, there is no equality. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; indicates an objection.&amp;ndash;The highest Self is not apprehended in earth and other places in the same way as the sun or a face is apprehended in water or a mirror. For the sun and a face are erroneously apprehended as abiding in water or a mirror; they do not really abide there. When, on the other hand, Scripture tells us that the highest Self dwells in the earth, in water, in the soul, &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>The participation (on Brahman&amp;rsquo;s part) in increase and decrease, due to its abiding within (is denied); on account of the appropriateness of both (comparisons), and because thus it is seen. The comparison of the highest Self to the reflected sun and the rest is meant only to deny of the Self that it participates in the imperfections&amp;ndash;such as increase, decrease, and the like&amp;ndash;which attach to the earth and the other beings within which the Self abides.</description>

      <description>For the text denies the previously declared so-muchness; and declares more than that. It is impossible to understand the text &amp;rsquo;not so, not so&amp;rsquo; as negativing those distinctions of Brahman which had been stated previously. If the text meant that, it would be mere idle talk. For none but a person not in his right mind would first teach that all the things mentioned in the earlier part of the section are distinctive attributes of Brahman&amp;ndash;as which they are not known by any other</description>

      <description>That (is) unmanifested; for (this Scripture) declares. Brahman is not manifested by other means of proof; for Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;His form is not to be seen, no one beholds him with the eye&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. II, 6, 9); &amp;lsquo;He is not apprehended by the eye nor by speech&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 1, 8).</description>

      <description>Also in perfect conciliation, according to Scripture and Smr̥ti. Moreover, it is only in the state of perfect conciliation or endearment, i.e. in meditation bearing the character of devotion, that an intuition of Brahman takes place, not in any other state. This Scripture and Smr̥ti alike teach. &amp;lsquo;That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by much learning. He whom the Self chooses by him the Self can be gained.</description>

      <description>And there is non-difference (of the intention of Brahman&amp;rsquo;s distinguishing attributes), as in the case of light; and the light (is) intuited as constituting Brahman&amp;rsquo;s essential nature by repetition of the practice (of meditation). That the clause &amp;rsquo;not so&amp;rsquo; negatives not Brahman&amp;rsquo;s possessing two forms, a material and an immaterial one, but only Brahman&amp;rsquo;s nature being restricted to those determinations, follows therefrom also that in the vision of Vāmadeva and others who had attained to intuition into Brahman&amp;rsquo;s nature, the fact of Brahman having all material and immaterial beings for its attributes is apprehended in non-difference, i.</description>

      <description>Hence (Brahman is distinguished) by what is infinite; for thus the characteristics (hold good). By the arguments stated it is proved that Brahman is distinguished by the infinite multitude of blessed qualities. And this being so, it follows that Brahman possesses the twofold characteristics.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;that which has twofold characteristics.&#39;</description>

      <description>But on account of twofold designation, as the snake and its coils. It has been shown in the preceding adhikaraṇa that
the entire non-sentient universe is the outward form of Brahman. For the purpose of proving Brahman&amp;rsquo;s freedom from all imperfection, an enquiry is now begun into the particular mode in which the world may be conceived to constitute the form of Brahman. Is the relation of the two like that of the snake and its coils; or like that of light and the luminous body, both of which fall under the same genus; or like that of the individual soul and Brahman, the soul being a distinguishing attribute and for that reason a part (aṁśa) of Brahman?</description>

      <description>Or else like light and its abode, both being fire. The or sets aside the other two alternatives. If Brahman itself only appeared in the form of non-sentient things&amp;ndash;as the snake itself only constitutes the coils&amp;ndash;both sets of texts, those which declare difference as well as those which declare the unchangeableness of Brahman, would be contrary to sense. We therefore, adopting the second alternative, hold that the case under discussion is analogous to that of light and that in which it abides, i.</description>

      <description>Or else in the manner stated above. The but sets aside the two preceding alternatives. One substance may indeed connect itself with several states, but the former of the two alternatives implies that Brahman itself constitutes the essential nature of non-sentient matter, and thus there is no escape from the objections already stated under Sūtra 27. Let then the second alternative be adopted according to which Brahma-hood (brahmatva) constitutes a genus inhering in Brahman as well as in non-sentient matter, just as fire constitutes the common genus for light and luminous bodies.</description>

      <description>And on account of denial. Texts such as &amp;lsquo;This is that great unborn Self, undecaying, undying&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 25), &amp;lsquo;By the old age of the body that does not age&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 1, 5), deny of Brahman the properties of non-sentient matter. From this it follows that the relation of the two can only be that of distinguishing attribute and thing distinguished, and hence of part and whole.</description>

      <description>(There is something) higher than that; on account of the designations of bridge, measure, connexion, and difference. The Sūtras now proceed to refute an erroneous view based on some fallacious arguments, viz. that there is a being higher even than the highest Brahman, the supreme cause, material as well as operative, of the entire world&amp;ndash;a refutation which will confirm the view of Brahman being free from all imperfections and a treasure as it were of countless transcendentally exalted qualities.</description>

      <description>But on account of resemblance. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; sets aside the pūrvapaksha. There is no truth in the assertion that from the designation of the Highest as a biidge (or bank) it follows that there is something beyond the Highest. For Brahman in that text is not called a bank with regard to something to be reached thereby; since the additional clause &amp;lsquo;for the non-confounding of these worlds&amp;rsquo; declares that it is compared to a bridge or bank in so far as it binds to itself (setu being derived from śi, to bind) the whole aggregate of sentient and non-sentient things without any confusion.</description>

      <description>It subserves the purpose of thought; as in the case of the feet. Where the texts speak of Brahman as having four quarters, and sixteen parts, or say that &amp;lsquo;one quarter of him are all these beings&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. III, 12, 6), they do so for the purpose of thought, i.e. meditation, only. For as texts such as &amp;rsquo;the Truth, knowledge, infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo; teach Brahman, the cause of the world, to be unlimited, it cannot in itself be subject to measure.</description>

      <description>Owing to difference of place, as in the case of light, and so on. Owing to the difference of limiting adjuncts constituted by special places, such as speech, and so on, Brahman in so far as connected with these adjuncts may be viewed as having measure; just as light and the like although spread everywhere may be viewed as limited, owing to its connexion with different places&amp;ndash;windows, jars, and so on.</description>

      <description>And on account of possibility. Nor is there any truth in the assertion that, because texts such as &amp;lsquo;he is the bridge of the Immortal&amp;rsquo; intimate a distinction between that which causes to reach and the object reached, there must be something to be reached different from that which causes to reach; for the highest Self may be viewed as being itself a means towards itself being reached; cp. &amp;lsquo;The Self cannot be reached by the Veda, and so on; he whom the Self chooses by him the Self can be gained&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.</description>

      <description>Thus, from the denial of anything else. Nor can we allow the assertion that there is something higher than the highest because certain texts (&amp;rsquo;the Person which is higher than the highest&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;beyond the Imperishable there is the highest,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.) refer to such a difference.
For the same texts expressly deny that there is anything else higher than the highest&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo;than whom there is nothing else higher, than whom there is nothing smaller or larger&amp;rsquo; (Śvet.</description>

That omnipresence which is possessed &amp;lsquo;by that,&amp;rsquo; i.e. by Brahman, and which is known &amp;lsquo;from declarations of extent,&amp;rsquo; and so on, i.e. from texts which declare Brahman to be all-pervading, is also known from texts such as &amp;lsquo;higher than that there is nothing.&amp;rsquo; Declarations of extent are e.g. the following: &amp;lsquo;By this Person this whole Universe is filled&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>From thence the reward; on account of possibility. It has been shown, for the purpose of giving rise to a desire for devout meditation, that the soul in all its states is imperfect, while the Supreme Person to be reached by it is free from imperfections, the owner of blessed qualities and higher than everything else. Being about to investigate the nature of meditation, the Sūtrakāra now declares that the meditating devotee receives the reward of meditation, i.</description>

      <description>And on account of scriptural declaration. That he bestows all rewards&amp;ndash;whether in the form of enjoyment or Release&amp;ndash;Scripture also declares &amp;lsquo;This indeed is the great, the unborn Self, the eater of food, the giver of
wealth&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 24); and &amp;lsquo;For he alone causes delight&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7).&amp;ndash;Next a primā facie view is stated.</description>

      <description>For the same reasons Jaimini (thinks it to be) religious action. For the same reasons, viz. possibility and scriptural declaration, the teacher Jaimini thinks that religious works, viz. sacrifices, gifts, offerings, and meditation, of themselves bring about their rewards. For we observe that in ordinary life actions such as ploughing and the like, and charitable gifts and so on, bring about their own reward, directly or indirectly. And although Vedic works do not bring about their rewards immediately, they may do so mediately, viz.</description>

      <description>But the former, Bādarāyaṇa (thinks), on account of the designation (of deities) as the cause. The reverend Bādarāyaṇa maintains the previously declared awarding of rewards by the Supreme Person since the scriptural texts referring to the different sacrifices declare that the deities only, Agni, Vāyu, and so on, who are propitiated by the sacrifices&amp;ndash;which are nothing else but means to propitiate deities&amp;ndash;are the cause of the rewards attached to the sacrifices.</description>
