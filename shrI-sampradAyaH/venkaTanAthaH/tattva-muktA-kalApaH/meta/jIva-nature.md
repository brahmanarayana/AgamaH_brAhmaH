Veṅkaṭanātha discussing the nature of #jīva in TMK II.17: There are four groups of people who think that the the ātman is not permanent: 
1. the ātman is of the nature of cognition and therefore destroyed at each new cognition (Buddhist Epistemological school?)
2. the ātman is destroyed w the body, 
3. the ātman is destroyed at pralaya (these are the Paurāṇikas), 
4. the ātman is destroyed at mokṣa (Advaita Vedāntins?). 2/

## Destruction at pralaya
He then explains that if the ātman were destroyed at the end of each kalpa, then duḥkha would also cease and that would be mokṣa and it would be realised w.o any effort. 

## Destruction with mokṣa
As for the forth, it cannot be that the mokṣamārga leads to 'svanāśa'. (Veṅkaṭanātha is always convincing both in analysis and rhetorics:-)

Veṅkaṭanātha explaining that the ātman is not destroyed: 

> ghaṭa-nāśe ghaṭākāśo 'pi na naśyaty eva  
(SS ad TMK 2.17). 

He also explains that mokṣa cannot mean destruction of everything, the difference created by karman is retained:

> mukti-daśāyāṃ bheda-nivṛtti-vādāś ca  
karma-kṛta-vaiṣamya-nivṛtti-parāḥ  
(SS ad TMK II.17.).

(Which leads to a Q: How can one distinguish among #nityasūri-s, that have no karman?) Things become even more interesting in TMK II.18, which presents an opponent saying that ātmans must be omnipresent (vyāptatva or sarvagatatva).

NB: As in other philosophical discussions on spatiotemporality of God in EU philosophy, nityatva is treated right before vibhutva in the TMK II. See SS ad TMK II.18: 

> nityatve tat-saha-caritaṃ sarva-gatatvam api syād—iti śaṅkate.

Anyway, the opponent says that ātmans must be omnipresent because they experience sukha, duḥkha, cognition (dhī) and volition (icchā) everywhere. The other evidence are the śrutis talking of omnipresence of ātman. 

Veṅkaṭanātha starts with the latter, and explains that they can be explained otherwise. For instance, śrutis talking of vāyu can be explained on the basis of the presence of repeated instances of individuals of the same species and the same can be applied to texts talking about the omnipresence of ātman
