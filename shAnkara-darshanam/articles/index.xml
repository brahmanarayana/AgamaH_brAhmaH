Brahman is the Eternal subject it is eternally a subject as awareness it [[56:57]] illumines everything and the entire universe including the mind, the body, AAAAAAAAAthe [[57:02]] sense organs are its objects. Brahman is the light of even the lights.
Not pratyakSha and anumAna Shankaracharya says [[57:38]] does not deny the validity or the capacity of the pramanas like perception [[57:44]] and anumana inference to produce valid knowledge in their respective spheres of [[57:51]] the empirical World.</description>

(Described elsewhere - veda is the only pramANa for brahman being prior to the opertion of pratyaxa and anumAna; anubhava being brahman itself.)
From mAdhavIya digvijaya
Here, the two birds are the Jiva and Brahman, and the Sruti asserts their difference. By this the Sruti contradicts the idea of their unity which, you say, is asserted by other Vedic sentences.
SANKARA: There are many Srutis condemning the perception of diversity as: &amp;lsquo;He who sees only diversity here, goes from death to death&amp;rsquo; etc.</description>
