      <description>Compilers preface While I was looking for a Sanskrit text version of Ashtavakra Samhita by Swami Nityaswarupananda,I stumbled upon the Study Notes of Swami Shraddhananda, compiled by Lalita Maly. These were from a study group headed by the famous and erudite scholar Shri subramanya Iyer during 1937 and 1939. who was the then pundit to the Maharaja of Mysore, ( of the state of Mysore ). These were nicely compiled and translated with punctuation wherever necessary and put in a good format.</description>

      <description>**Janaka said: **
**1.1 Master, how is Knowledge to be achieved, detachment acquired, liberation attained? **
HOW TO ATTAIN KNOWLEDGE
.It is only those that seek knowledge, they alone take to this book. Janaka is confused. He says, “Some say mukti (liberation) is attained if one goes to die in Benares, some say mukti is gotten after death. Some say it is achieved if one goes to Jerusalem, and so on.</description>

      <description>Ashtavakra said:
** 10.1 Give up desire, which is the enemy. Give up prosperity, which is born of mischief and good works. Be indifferent.**
PEACE (REST)
** 10.2 Look upon friends, lands, wealth, houses, wives, gifts&amp;ndash; and all apparent good fortune&amp;ndash; as a passing show, as a dream lasting three to five days. **
10.3 Where there is desire, there is the world. Be firm in non-attachment. Be free of desire.</description>

      <description>**Ashtavakra said: **
**11.1 Existence, non-existence, change&amp;ndash; this is the nature of things. Realizing this, stillness, serenity and bliss naturally follow. **
WISDOM IN LIFE
The point is appearance, disappearance, change—they necessarily come and necessarily happen. You cannot prevent them. This chapter shows how you can pacify your mind, seeing that events are not in your control. Pain: Not a happy translation.
[The word] [S] klesha also refers to mental suffering.</description>

      <description>** Janaka said:**
** 12.1 Becoming first intolerant of action, then of excessive speech, then of thought itself, I come to be here. **
STEPS LEADING TO WISDOM
Janaka narrates the stages of discipline. I want to know an idea of [S] Drik, the inmost thing. So I have to detach myself from the [S] Drishyam.
Intolerant: I don’t allow them[objects] to interfere with my knowledge of [S] Drik. Action, speech, thought, these are all [S] Drishyam.</description>

      <description>** Janaka said:**
** 13.1 The tranquil state of knowing Self alone is rare— even among those who own but a loincloth. I therefore neither renounce nor accept and am happy**
BLISS
Loin-cloth: If to you this is something other than yourself. You must be able to see everything as Brahman. Then, you will get perfect calmness of mind.
**13.2 The body is strained by practices. The tongue tires of scripture.</description>

      <description>** Janaka said:**
** 14.1 Though appearing asleep like other men, one whose interest in the world is exhausted, whose mind has been emptied, who thinks only by inadvertence, is in Reality awake.**
BLISS TESTED
Emptied of (worldly) thoughts: Necessary at one stage. Awake though asleep: Even when you see a second thing, your mind does not take it as real.
** 14.2 When desire has melted, how can there be wealth, or friends, or the seduction of senses?</description>

      <description>Ashtavakra said:
** 15.1 A man of open intuition may realize the Self upon hearing a casual instruction, while a man of cluttered intellect inquires bewildered for a lifetime.**
SELF REALIZATIO Intellect: [text changed to] Determination [S] Buddhi.
** 15.2 Aversion to the world’s offerings is liberation. Attraction to the world’s offerings is the suffering of bondage. This is the truth. Now do as you please.**
Distaste for sense-objects: This comes when they are known to be unreal.</description>

      <description>** Ashtavakra said:**
** 16.1 You can recite and discuss scripture all you want, but until you drop everything you will never know Truth. **
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION
You must begin by studying scripture.
16.2 You can enjoy and work and meditate, but you will still yearn for That which is beyond all experience, and in which all desires are extinguished
**16.3 Everyone is miserable because they exert constant effort. But no one understands this.</description>

      <description>** Ashtavakra said:**
** 17.1 One has attained Knowledge and reaped the fruits of yoga who is content, purified of attachments and at home in solitude. **
KNOWER OF TRUTH. Purified senses: See everything but without any desire of possession.
**17.2 The knower of Truth is never miserable in the world, for the whole universe is filled with Himself alone. **
In this world…Whole universe: Not the universe of the yogi seen by shutting one’s eyes, but this wide world of joys and sorrows.</description>

      <description>** Ashtavakra said &amp;mdash; **
**1. Salutation to That which is bliss itself by nature, calmness, and effulgence, with the dawning of the knowledge of which all delusion becomes like a dream. **
KNOWER OF TRUTH
**2. One gets plenty of enjoyments by acquiring all kinds of worldly objects. Surely one cannot be happy without renouncing all. **
[B] Acquiring many things, we get lots of enjoyment; without renouncing gross and subtle pleasures, peace is far away.</description>

      <description>SEEKING REST IN ATMAN
**Janaka said &amp;mdash; **
**1. I have extracted from the inmost recess of my heart the thorn of different opinions, using the pincers of the knowledge of Truth. **
2. Where is dharma, where is kama, where is artha? Where, too, is discrimination, where is duality, and where, even, is non-duality for me who abide in my own glory?
**3. Where is past, where is future, where, even, is the present?</description>

      <description>Janaka said:
** 2.1 I am now spotless and at peace&amp;ndash; Awareness beyond Consciousness. All this time I have been duped by illusion.**
STATE OF REALIZATION
.Cf. 13th Chapter of the Gita. That which comes and goes. Going is more important. But I am permanent. Then, subsequently, I will see that even nature is myself. Nature: Sense objects. Illusion: i.e. which goes and comes and goes away. Inside thoughts come and go, and outside, if you have studied science, you will see that every particle changes.</description>

      <description>REALIZATION AND LAST STAGE OF LIFE
** Janaka said &amp;mdash; **
** 1. Where are the elements, where is the body, where are the organs, and where is the mind; where is the void; where, too, is despair for me who am taintless by nature? **
**2. Where are the scriptures, where is knowledge of the Self, where is the mind not attached to sense-objects, where is contentment, and where is desirelessness for me who am ever devoid of the sense of duality?</description>

      <description>** Ashtavakra said: **
3.1 Having realized yourself as One, being serene and indestructible, why do you desire wealth?
SEEKER’S STEPS .Known yourself: Theoretically, convinced but not realised finally. Attached: When the thought of the acquisition of wealth comes, think of the nature of Atman. That is what the author means.
** 3.2 Just as imagining silver in mother-of-pearl, causes greed to arise, so does ignorance of Self cause desire for illusion.</description>

      <description>** Janaka said**
**4.1 Surely one who knows Self, though he plays the game of life, differs greatly from the world’s bewildered burdened beasts. **
SEEKER’S EXPERIENCE 1.He may be enjoying, but his mind will always be in Brahman alone. The deluded beasts of the world [text changed to]: these fools who are deluded by the world.
Game of enjoyment: [S] lila – not taking [it] seriously.
**4.2 Truly the yogi feels no elation, though he abides in the exalted state yearned for by Indra and all the discontented gods.</description>

      <description>** Ashtavakra said: **
5.1 You are immaculate, touched by nothing. What is there to renounce? The mind is complex—let it go. Know the peace of dissolution.
NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE 1.Before you say I renounce this, that will be gone. Automatically it is being renounced. You are the [S] Drik.
[Section of unreadable Bengali]
As the Western Materialists, you see that the body and the world are constantly moving away – passing away.</description>

      <description>** Janaka said: **
6.1 I am infinite space; the universe is a jar. This I know. No need to renounce, accept or destroy.
WHAT IS REAL KNOWLEDGE
Boundless: Don’t think that you are limited in your body. Nothing is to go. To know the world, its real value – this is [S] jnanam and not shutting one’s eyes.
A jar: Space inside and outside. No Nirvikalpa samadhi. All that is rubbish.</description>

      <description>** Janaka said:**
** 7.1 In me, the shoreless ocean, the ark of universe drifts here and there in the winds of its nature. I am not impatient.**
PRACTICAL LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE
In me: Not the ego. The universe taken as a whole is constantly changing.
[B] I am the ocean, the entire world.
** 7.2 In me, the shoreless ocean, let the waves of the universe rise and fall as they will.</description>

      <description>Ashtavakra said:
** 8.1 When the mind desires or grieves things, accepts or rejects things, is pleased or displeased by things&amp;ndash; this is bondage. **
IGNORANCE AND KNOWLEDGE.
Bondage: Bound by ideas.
[B] Desire, sorrow, renunciation, acceptance, joy, anger.
8.2 When the mind does not desire or grieve, accept or reject, become pleased or displeased, liberation is at hand.
All ideas reduced to cognition only. No attachment to any idea. Let ideas come and go.</description>
