BRAHMA VIDYA
What should we talk about, except meditation? But, it is necessary to talk about meditation now. You have been doing it right now for the past forty five minutes. It is better to meditate than to talk about it. After deep absorption in meditation, one does not feel like talking and doing anything for some time, because the mind goes after the joy one had in meditation.</description>

Sarvasaara upanishad and Niralamba Upanishad have been classified under twenty four ordinary Upanishads.
These two contain the vedantic terminology and are like a dictionary of vedantic terms used in the Upanishads.
Sarvasaara upanishad belongs to the Atharvaveda.
Although this appears in Krishna yajurveda also, their differences seem to be very small. TWENTY three different aspects of the Vedic terminology has been explained in this Upanishad.</description>

In the matter of mantras there are two major divisions. One is the Vedic and the other is the tantric. Whatever we read about mantras, repetition etc relates to the tantric aspect. But the Vedic mantra is merely hymns of the Rig-Veda. So, the mantra is more powerful than the hymns. The Vedic mantras are called apourusheya, not a product of the human mind.</description>

Most of us know about what is a heard melody and how it sounds to one‟s ears and how comfortable and soothing it can be. Melody means a soothing experience one gets from a source of music. Much of this depends on the tuning, either of the instruments or the singer in question. On the other hand, to produce a melody which is &amp;ldquo;unheard&amp;rdquo; requires a tremendous amount of capacity which very few people acquire.</description>
