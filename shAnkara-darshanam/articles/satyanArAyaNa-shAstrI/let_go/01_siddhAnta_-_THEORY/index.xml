      <description>Having been trained in the ways of science, I was simply drawn to Upaniṣad-s when I started reading them in view of the meticulous way the subject is dealt with. The more and more I read the Upaniṣad-s along with commentories of Adi Shankara, an extremely powerful commentary on the original text of Upaniṣad-s, I as a scientist could not but wonder and appreciate them.
A scientific approach to any matter/ problem demands the following:</description>

      <description>In our last talk we tried to bring out the differences between karmakāṇḍa and jñānakāṇḍa. It is possible that I have spoken lightly of karmakāṇḍa, but karmakāṇḍa is a very valuable part of Vedas. I was just showing the differences in the content, rather than emphasising the superior ways in which jñānakāṇḍa takes us in the realm of spiritual study. Whosoever has that śraddhā and devotion to karmakāṇḍa details is certainly a superior person.</description>

      <description>(EXAMINATION OF THREE STATES OF EXISTANCE)
We shall do a revision on whatever we discussed in these lectures so that they remain fresh in your minds. Recapitulation is fine as it strengthens the thought pattern and sets deep rooted in your minds.We have found that Vedānta can give a solvable approach to the problems of various facets of our life. We found that there are two sides. One is the ritualistic side.</description>

      <description>(KNOWLEDGE OF FIVE SHEATHS OF EXISTANCE)
Another equally important prakriya about understanding the ‘self’ isbeautifully explained in Taittirīya Upaniṣad and it is quite interesting. We will now deliberate on this prakriya as it is called as Pañca-kośa-viveka which is contained in the Bhṛguvalli (2) of the said Upaniṣad.
भृगुर्वै वारुणिः वरुणं पितरं उपससार अधीहि भगवो ब्रह्मेति ॥
Bhr̥gurvai vāruṇiḥ varuṇaṁ pitaraṁ upasasāra adhīhi bhagavō brahmēti.
There is seeker called Bhṛgu. He goes to his teacher who is also his father by name Varuṇa.</description>
