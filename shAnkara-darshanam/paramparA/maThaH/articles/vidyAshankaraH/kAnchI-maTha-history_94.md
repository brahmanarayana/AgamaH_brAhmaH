Both this post and a previous one by Bon Giovanni have raised questions of  historicity of Adi Sankaracharya and the Kanchi math. This is not a new  question. It is generally accepted as tradition that Adi Sankaracharya,  the famous Advaita philosopher, founded four maths (monasteries) at  Sringeri, Puri, Dwaraka and Badrinath; that he ascended the famous  sarvagna-pitha in Kashmir, and finally passed away near Kedarnath. None of  the four recognized mathas claims jurisdiction over the other three. However,  the Kanchi math claims that Sankaracharya established a fifth math in  Kanchi, with jurisdiction over the recognized four mathas; that  Sankaracharya ascended a sarvagna-pitha not in Kashmir, but at Kanchi, and  that he passed away not in Kedarnath, but at Kanchi. These and other such  claims have been widely publicized by the followers of the Kanchi math  with the direct participation of and encouragement from the heads of the  Kanchi math, including the recently departed centenarian Sri  Chandrasekharendra Saraswati (C.S., for short) and his successor Sri  Jayendra Saraswati (J.S.).

In Tamil, we have a saying "Do not question the origins of rivers (nadimoolam) and rishis (rishimoolam)." Still, in terms of answering some  basic questions regarding dates in Indian history, one has to perforce  look at these. C.S. had a commanding personality. He impressed people of  such wide interests as Mahatma Gandhi, Arthur Koestler, Paul Brunton,  Milton Singer etc. Some of his more ardent followers have gone to the  extent of deifying him as "Nadamadum deivam" - the deity who walks. People  compose and sing songs in his praise, and dancers stage dance-dramas on his  life - all of which are widely advertised and reviewed in the south Indian  press. However, while some people might respect the recently departed  acharya of Kanchi as a rishi or as a deity, there is no reason why a frank  discussion cannot be held regarding the origins of the Kanchi math, and  C.S.'s involvement in propagating a thoroughly revised history of that  math - so thoroughly revised as to be almost wholly falsified. I would  like to clarify at the outset that no disrespect is meant to the Kanchi  math or its heads, but while talking of some aspects of history, one has  to call a spade a spade.

Seven years ago, on August 22, 1987, Sri Jayendra Saraswati disappeared  from the Kanchi math. R. Venkatraman, an ardent devotee of the Kanchi math  was President of India at that time. A frantic search was held, with the  police of all four southern states, the CID and other agencies involved.  What made the disappearance more shocking to the orthodox followers of the  Kanchi math was that it was the period of chaturmasya, when a sannyasi was  not supposed to travel from his camping station. Sri Jayendra Saraswati  was finally traced to Talakaveri, the source of the Kaveri near Coorg in  Karnataka. Whatever else it accomplished, this episode created major stories
in the Indian media. Tthe Kanchi math came under the spotlight once again,
and it obtained wide publicity in the national media. I quote a few excerpts
(without permission) from the Sept. 13, 1987 issue of The Illustrated Weekly
of India, from a feature written by well-known journalist, K. P. Sunil. [1]

Under a box titled "Disputed Lineage," K. P. Sunil writes, (My comments  are in parantheses):

>	"On August 25, as speculation about the whereabouts of Jayendra  Saraswati mounted, the Sankaracharya of Dwaraka, Swaroopananda Saraswati,  camping at Pune for the Chaturmasya Vrata, while demanding a high level  probe into the mystery, asserted: "Sri Jayendra Saraswati cannot be  regarded as a Sankaracharya at all, because the Kanchi math is not one of  the four peethas constituted by Adi Sankaracharya. It is only a shakha (branch) of the Sringeri peetham."
> 
> "Several years earlier, Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer, who headed the  central commission on Hindu religious and charitable endowments, had  announced that 'there is no such thing as the Kanchi Kamakoti peetham.' .................. Yet the Kanchi math has emerged as one of the most powerful  religious institutions in the country. Full credit for this should go to Chandrasekharendra Saraswati  himself, who lifted a math disintegrating in Kumbhakonam and  re-established it in Kanchipuram, according it a position of pre-eminence. .................... 
> 
> Legend has it that Sankara, at the age of 32, after having toured  most parts of India and after having established the four maths ........ The turn of the present century saw a math claiming a lineage of  over 67 pontiffs in Kumbhakonam in Tanjore district. ..............
> 
> It was only in the 20th century works, all compiled after  Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, the present Paramacharya ascended the  peetha, that the history of the Kanchipuram math has been rewritten.  Accordingly, it was established (by whom, may I ask?) that Adi  Sankaracharya had spent the last days of his life in Kanchipuram where he  attained samadhi, and not in the Himalayas as is generally believed. A  mandapam named after the father of the school of advaita philosophy, seen  in the Kamakshi temple premises, is cited as his samadhi. (The said  mandapam has been constructed very recently. It was originally called 'Sankaracharya samadhi', but when it was pointed out there could not be a  samadhi inside a Devi temple, the mandapam was renamed 'Sankaracharya  sannidhi' - sanctum, not a tomb.)
> 
> The twentieth century chronicles explain that before his demise,  Sankaracharya established a fifth math at Kanchi which he intended to be a  controlling centre of all the other maths. Sri Sureswaracharya, Sankara's  prime disciple was placed in charge of it. Interestingly, the Sringeri  math also claims Sureswaracharya as their first pontiff. (As an aside, the  tale of Sureswaracharya being in charge of the Kanchi math is pure  fiction. If Sankaracharya did not establish the Kanchi math at all,  where was the need to appoint a successor there?!! It is the Kanchi math  that "claims" Sureswara. The Sringeri math does not "claim" so. In fact, a  very old structure that is reputed to be Sureswara's samadhi is still  preserved outside the Sarada temple at Sringeri.)
> 
> According to the Kanchi chronicles, the math in Kanchipuram had  to be shifted in the 18th century AD, in the face of opposition from local  kings and hence the shift to Kumbhakonam. (One does not know of any  Hindu-hating king near Kanchipuram from the 18th century.)
> 
> Historians, however, hold that the Kumbhakonam math was in verity  a branch of the Sringeri math established in 1821 AD by the famous monarch  of Tanjore, Serfoji. (Mr. Sunil has a fact wrong here. The monarch of  Tanjore in 1821 was not Serfoji, but Pratap Singh Tuljaji. The  date 1821 is correct - it is the date of the oldest inscription found in  the Kumbhakonam math building.) Later, when a war broke out between the  kings of Tanjore and Mysore, the Kumbhakonam math proclaimed independence  from Sringeri and established itself as the Kamakoti peetham. (There is  no war documented between the Maratha rulers of Tanjore and the Wodeyars  of Mysore after 1821. By this time, both were more or less puppets of the  British. That the Kumbhakonam math proclaimed independence from Sringeri  however, is a fact. One does not have to explain it as a consequence of an  imaginary war that the maths had no connection with.)

Mr. Sunil captures the major facts regarding the Kanchi math correctly  though. Briefly,

1. A branch of the Sringeri math was established in Kumbhakonam, the  
   building for which was constructed in 1821 AD, with the help of the  
   Tanjore king. The seal of this math is in Kannada language, and refers to  
   it as a "Sarada math." Since Sarada is worshipped only at Sringeri, and  
   the Goddess at Kanchipuram is Kamakshi, not Sarada, it is seen at once  
   that the Kumbhakonam math did not originally come from Kanchipuram.

2. The Kumbhakonam math soon proclaimed independence from Sringeri. In  
   fact, this math went one step further. In addition to denying the  
   historical truth of its origin as a branch of the Sringeri math, the story  
   propagated was that it was originally established by Adi Sankaracharya  
   himself at Kanchipuram, with control over the recognized four maths.  
   Worse, a wholly fictitious story that Adi Sankaracharya ascended a  
   sarvagna-pitha at Kanchi and attained samadhi at Kanchi is propagated as  
   "tradition." The real problem though was that in the course of this  
   campaign, someone with more enthusiasm than scholarship, "fixed" the date  
   of Adi Sankaracharya as 477 B.C. and wrote up a continuous list of gurus  
   of the math from 477 B.C. to the present! This guru parampara is filled  
   with names of sannyasis taken at random, with no thought to chronology.

3. The Kumbhakonam math shifted to Kanchipuram in accordance with its new  
   story. In 1839 AD, the head of the Kumbhakonam math applied for permission  
   to the English Collector to perform the kumbhabhishekam of the Kamakshi  
   temple in Kanchipuram. In 1842 AD, he was appointed sole trustee of the  
   Kamakshi temple by the English East India Company Government. This is well  
   documented because the original priests of the Kamakshi temple, who were
   thereby deprived of their rights, complained to whomever they could possibly
   complain to. Numerous petitions, counter petitions, letters, and other such
   documents are available from this period that allow us to piece together this
   account. [2] Thus the Kanchi math as an institution dates from 1842 AD. The
   headquarters continued to be at Kumbhakonam but the sannyasi head would
   periodically visit Kanchipuram to assert his rights over the Kamakshi temple.
   This math originally had a limited following in the Tanjore and Kanchipuram
   areas, but soon embarked on a massive propaganda campaign that ensured it
   prominence.

4. This propaganda campaign to disseminate disinformation received a major  
   fillip from the activites of C.S. As Mr. Sunil puts it, it is only in the  
   20th century, after C.S. took over as the head of the disintegrating math  
   at Kumbhakonam, that the accounts have been totally rewritten. Part of this  
   propaganda campaign includes a guru parampara that dates back to 477 BC.  
   One can go into great details to show that this guru parampara is false.  
   Suffice it to say however, that it is full of holes and is correct only in  
   the details given for the post-1820 period. Thus J.S. who is said to be  
   the 69th in direct succession from Adi Sankaracharya himself is actually  
   only the 6th or the 7th head  of the Kumbhakonam/Kanchi math. C.S. and   
   J.S. have been extremely fortunate in favourably impressing people like  
   Dr. T. M. P. Mahadevan, the famous philosopher, and Sri S. Ramakrishnan,  
   the executive secretary of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, not to speak of  
   influential journalists like Arun Shourie and Ram Nath Goenka, and
   politicians like President R. Venkatraman. As an example, in recent years,
   there has not been a single issue of the Bhavan's Journal without some
   feature or the other on either C.S. or J.S. For example, when the Berlin wall
   fell, the well-known guru, Sri Chinmoy, sent a piece of the rubble to the
   Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan as a souvenir. Sri Ramakrishnan immediately saw a
   photo opportunity, took the rock to Kanchipuram, and featured a picture of
   J.S. holding the rock on the cover of the Bhavan's Journal. Thus, Sri Chinmoy
   sends a souvenir to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and J.S. of Kanchi Kamakoti
   Peetham gets photo credit! Sri Ramakrishnan apparently has no qualms in
   converting a prestigious magazine like the Bhavan's Journal into yet another
   propaganda pamphlet of the Kanchi math.

If I sound like I am fulminating unjustifiably against the propaganda that  the Kanchi math engages in, I assure readers here that I am in fact  perfectly justified. I can cite innumerable instances where the most  blatant lies have been made without any compunction. All with an eye at  enhancing the apparent prestige of the Kanchi math. What the Kanchi math  doen't realize however, is that such stories only weaken its own  credibility and the respect which people may have for its acharyas. Thus a  simple PTI news item about the 60th birthday celebrations of J.S.  necessarily has to state something about the "2500 year history" of the  math. If the news item had been silent about it, I would not have felt the  need to write this article debunking their myths. The following excerpt  from the same article in the Illustrated Weekly should show readers the  exact means which the Kanchi math propaganda adopts.

> The Vyasachaliya Sankara Vijayam, written by Maha Devendra  Saraswati, the 53rd acharya of the Kumbhakonam math in the 15th century,  makes no mention of the Kanchi math in his work. However, in a Tamil  translation of the work by Acharya Krishna Sastri, it is mentioned that  the then King of Nepal had accepted the acharya of Kanchi, located in  Kumbhakonam, as his Rajguru and was making a payment to the math every  year as guru dakshina.
> 
> Researchers, who doubted the claim, referred the matter to the  royal family of Nepal. the reply dated May 13. 1940 read '...Nepal has  never recognized the head of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham as their guru.  Nor do we annually contribute any portion of our income as alleged by  Pandit Acharya Krishna Sastri.'

Mr. Sunil who quotes this bit of history, seems to have overlooked one  minor point though. If the Kumbhakonam math was only established as a  branch math in 1821 AD, as he says in his article, the question of its  existence in the 15th century does not arise. Much less a name of its head  and a number to be attached to that name. Such "Pandits" as Acharya  Krishna Sastri who do not hesitate to blatantly lie, have been routinely  pressed into service by the Kanchi math for conducting its propaganda.  After all, who in south India would have thought of verifying his story  from such a distant place as Nepal? The technique of the Kanchi math has  been to lie left and right, with such thoroughness, that invariably some  part of its preposterous claims are accepted as truth by people. Exactly  the same phenomenon has occured with Mr. Sunil. He does not question the veracity of the claim that the Vyasachaliya Sankara Vijayam was written by one "Maha Devendra Saraswati, the 53rd acharya of the Kumbhakonam math in the 15th century." Nor does he particularly elaborate on the strangeness of the fact that this fictitious author of this real book only mentions the four traditionally accepted maths, and makes no mention of "his own" math.

To sum up, the claims of the Kanchi math have been unprecedented in the  history of Hinduism. We have never had an organized structure comparable  to the Roman Catholic Church. In the event, a math in the remote south  claiming to be the central math of the Advaita sampradaya makes no sense.  Firstly, such centralized religious jurisdiction is alien to the spirit  and history of our culture. Secondly, even if Adi Sankaracharya did  establish a central math with jurisdiction over the recognized four, was  he so ignorant of India's geography that he bypassed all holy cities with  more central locations (Prayag/Kashi/Ujjain?) and chose instead Kanchi in  the extreme south? Thus, the idea of a central math is clearly pure myth.  The reality is that the Kanchi math is a relatively recent institution  with tall claims. That it has a large following is an undeniable fact.  Every saffron-robed person invariably attracts some following. Couple that  with the tremendous charisma that C.S. had, and a famous temple like the  Kamakshi temple in Kanchipuram - one has a ready-made formula for success  in attracting a following. The sad part is that the sannyasis involved  take advantage of the general reverence that people show them, for their  own ulterior motives.

In India, among south Indian Brahmin circles especially, when this topic  comes up for discussion, most people usually say something like, "The  Kanchi math is also doing so much for the cause of dharma. Why rake up  this issue?" My answer is that firstly it is the Kanchi math which forces  one to rake up the issue by ceaselessly continuing its propaganda of  disinformation. Secondly, and more importantly, an institution like the  Kanchi math which supposedly is doing so much for dharma, should not  forget the most basic dharma of all - satyam vada. People are free to choose  their gurus, but when the guru sets such a perniciously wrong example, by  not sticking to the truth, dharma itself is compromised.
