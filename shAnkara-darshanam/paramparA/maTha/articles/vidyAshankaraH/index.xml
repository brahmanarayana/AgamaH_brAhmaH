      <description>The Jyotirmaṭha Śaṅkarācārya Lineage in the 20th Century
Vidyāśaṅkar Sundareśan
This page was first born in response to the INDOLOGY listserv discussion (January 19, 1998) about the [Śaṅkarācārya of the North], and has been updated a few times since then. Barring fresh developments in future, this version (July 2000) will be final.
There is currently a succession dispute at the Jyotirmaṭha Śaṅkarācārya seat, the origin of which dates back to the year 1953.</description>

      <description>Subject: Real history of the Kanchi math (Re: Former President Inaugurates&amp;hellip;) Celebrations
From: vidya@cco.caltech.edu (Vidyasankar Sundaresan)
Date: 3 Aug 1994 04:05:16 GMT
Both this post and a previous one by Bon Giovanni have raised questions of historicity of Adi Sankaracharya and the Kanchi math. This is not a new question. It is generally accepted as tradition that Adi Sankaracharya, the famous Advaita philosopher, founded four maths (monasteries) at Sringeri, Puri, Dwaraka and Badrinath; that he ascended the famous sarvagna-pitha in Kashmir, and finally passed away near Kedarnath.</description>

      <description>Conflicting hagiographies and history: The place of Śaṅkaravijaya texts in Advaita tradition
Vidyasankar Sundaresan
THE TEXTS AND THEIR CULTURAL CONTEXT Many legendary stories are current about Śaṅkarācārya, the teacher of Advaita Vedānta, some of which are recorded in texts known as the Śaṅkaravijayas.&amp;rsquo; The oft-quoted dates for Śaṅkara (788-820 CE) are found in one of these hagio graphic texts, but internal evidence from Śaṅkara&amp;rsquo;s undisputed works suggests a date earlier in the eighth century.</description>
